A sketch for arduino intended to be used by Hyperiond to drive my WS2812 leds.

Hyperion needs to be set with:
	* no gamma gorrection
	* no color correction
	* linear smoothing set this way:
		"type"            : "linear",
		"time_ms"         : 0,
		"updateFrequency" : 50.0000,
		"updateDelay"     : 0,
		"continuousOutput": true

This sketch performs:
	* Gamma and color correction by using prebuilt
	  gamma correction tables stored in PROGMEM
	* (switch) Scene change detection
	* (switch) slow fades between frames in the same scene
	  (step smoothing and/or windowed average)
	* (switch) fast fades between frames when the scene changes
	* 4bit dithering to overcome WS2812 limitations when apply gamma correction
	* (switch) FastLED dithering on low brightness scene
	* Fixed point math for performance reasons
	* Realtime configuration via serial comunication to arduino

It works well, but at very low brightness it is still not 100% smooth.
In paticular i noted a kind of flickering that probably happens
when leds "ping-pong switches" off and on .

Possible workaround:
	Push minimum brightness value to something > 0.
	The following pushes an extra 10% of 'luminance' (-b "0.1 0.1 0.1")
	and compensate the loss of saturation by pushing an extra 20% saturation (-s 1.2)
	eg: hyperion-remote -b "0.1 0.1 0.1" -s 1.2
